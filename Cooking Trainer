#This script will train cooking to whatever level you set. It will train Cooked Ribs or Cooked Fish Steaks
#up to 100, and Ribs Baskets and Fish Steak Baskets to 120. Whether you want to train with ribs or fish is
#selectable below.

#You must create restock agent #5 in the Razor "Agents" tab to restock 25 ribs (or fish), 2 kindling
#and 2 skillets.

#Fill your bankbox with as many skillets, ribs/fish, and kindling as you'll need (lots)

#Stand close enough to the bank to open the bankbox (which will happen automatically)

#Choose the base food type, 2545 for ribs, 2426 for fish
@setvar! foodType 2545

#Set the maximum skill level you want to train to
@setvar! skillTarget 100
